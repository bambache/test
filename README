Project Idea:
  - build small application to act as a signal generator using the audio output of the PC
  - use a lightweight audio framework,  eg Portaudio, or maybe SDL audio later to be able to show the waveforms
  - at first output simple signals such as sine, sawtooth,, etc
  - later build a decent gui
